        <p>I am 21 years old and I am student at the University of the West Indies. I am a computing student. This course (INFO2180) has been quite interesting so far, in my opinion. I am currently doing other courses like such as: COMP2201, COMP2190 and COMP2130. I enjoy reading, painting and playing video games. I aim to do best to do well in this course.</p>
