        <p>I am a 21 year old student at the University of the West Indies. I'm majoring in Computer science. I am currently doing Dynamic Web Development 1 (INFO2180), which, as the name suggests, is web a development course. I think web development is interesting for a few different reasons. Designing the layout is quite appealing to me because I like doing art so I get to engage that creative muscle. Where HTML is concerned, I like how simple it is. It may not be as elaborate or well put together as when you use other methods but, I like how instant the results are. I think brings a strong sense of fulfilment when you interact with the finished product and see how well everything came together. I'm interested in seeing where this course takes me.</p>
